The solution to the given problem which I created is Azure cloud based. I use Azure Data Lake for storage, Azure Synapse pipelines for data transformation and ingestion and I use Azure Synapse Serverless Pool as a Data Warehouse. The Azure Synapse workspace can be accessed on the following link (after you have been added to the security role):
